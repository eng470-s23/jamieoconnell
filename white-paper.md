## Project Summary/Abstract 

Beyond Toxics is an environmental justice group that started in Eugene, Oregon when a group of people came together to fight for the neighborhoods and families that toxins are affecting. As they have been a group since 1996 they have succeeded in getting multiple laws passed as well as making a huge impact on the community of Eugene. The goal of my project is for researchers to have one place to locate when they want to research who Beyond Toxics is. The [timeline](/Timeline.md) will walk researchers through the company over the last twenty-seven years and highlight their accomplishments.

## Project Origins and Goals

I chose to focus on this topic because of how important environmental justice is. The issue of toxins is a much bigger issue than most people think it is and it mainly impacts lower-income areas which are usually lived in by people of color. Not only is environmental justice an issue for the planet but it also goes back into being a race issue. 

West Eugene has seen a number of people in their community impacted by the toxins that are spread in the air, ground, and water because of the factories that get built in these areas. West Eugene is a more affordable area for lower-income people but at what cost when there are toxic fumes they are breathing in every single day and are killing people. 

A group of people decided to come together and great a group to fight for people living in West Eugene. Beyond Toxics was formed and has impacted the community and changed so much over the last twenty-seven years. I think it is important to recognize these groups and acknowledge what they do for these communities. The issue of environmental justice is not only in Eugene but all over Oregon. The group targets Eugene as they are based out of Eugene but they have gotten multiple laws passed in the state to help protect the planet and multiple Oregon communities. 

I wanted to create a timeline showing where Beyond Toxics has taken itself over the last twenty-seven years and what they have done for not only Oregon but specifically Eugene. Many people do not understand or realize this is happening only a couple miles away from the University and it is important Eugene begins paying attention to how this is impacting their community but also acknowledging what Beyond Toxics has done for the community. 



## Project, Activities, and Participants

I learned how to use many new softwares, was connected with the school library in multiple ocasions and learned a lot of information about the founders of Beyond Toxics. 

## Project Outcomes

While creating this project I was able to gather a number of data and information. I learned many new skills by using GitHub and TimeLine JS which was frustrating at times but very rewarding in the end to see everything come together. I also enjoyed learning a lot of new information on the Beyond Toxics program and what they have done for Eugene. I got to learn how to store data in multiple locations on my laptop and now use Google Drive for multiple things. I also got to put my project into a [presentation](/presentation.md) which I enjoyed presenting to people and receiving feedback on things to improve as well as things that seem to be going well. 

## Project Continuation and Long-Term Impact

In the long-term I hope this project is useful for those researching environmental justice in Oregon. I hope to have it accessible for those looking into what has been done in Eugene thus far regarding environmental justice and who has made a change in the community.
