# The Impact of Beyond Toxics on Environmental Justice in Eugene



Hello! My name is Jamie O'Connell and for my project, I chose to research about Beyond Toxics. As I was researching the environmental justice group I was not able to find a clear timeline in one place that gives information on who they are and what they have done for Eugene as a community. I chose to create a written timeline as well as a interactive timleine to show what Beyond Toxics has done over the last twenty three years. Below I have given links to show how I put my project together, starting from week one of the terms until now. Each link will lead you to information on the project and eventually builds up to a page with all of the information I gathered, followed by a link to the timeline I created for those who enjoy visually learning.

# Timeline
 

## 1996
Excavation of Hyundai discovered marine fossils 
Eugene began building a Hyundai and they were building it in a wetlands which was going to be releasing toxic chemicals into the air. They asked Hyundai to release which chemicals they would be releasing and they denied which resulted in getting 11,000 signatures on a Toxics Right-to-Know Reporting Law that would require not only Hyundai, but all of the industries that were using toxics within the Eugene city boundaries to report all of the toxics they took in, and which ones left. Attached is a [link](/Interviewtranscript.md) of the transcript of the audio interview of Mary O'Brien, one of the founders, talking about the start of Beyond Toxics. 

## 1999
Pesticide Use Reporting System: The reports must include the specific site where the pesticide was applied and detail the kind and amount of pesticides used. This was passed and created by Beyond Toxics in hopes to collect data on what chemicals are in nearby streams or rivers. 

## 2001 
After this law was passed, the State Legislature, and Governor Kitzhaber, passed a law that said no other community could pass a law like this. Since this law did so well in Eugene and had good feedback, the idea of forming what was originally called the Oregon Toxics Alliance began by Mary O’Brien. Oregon Toxics Alliance formed by Mary O’Brien, Anita Johnson, Michael Carrigan, Steve Johnson & others 

## 2003
Defended residents from the dangers of toxic groundwater plumes in Trainsong and River Road neighborhoods. Forced Union Pacific to reimburse families for the loss of access to well water and to test air quality in homes.

## 2005
Launched “Healthy Air Oregon” and achieved a statewide ban on the practice of topping off gas tanks to reduce carcinogens and air pollution. 

## 2006 
Petitioned Oregon Health Authority performed a cancer study in West Eugene which resulted in finding many increased numbers of lung cancer in West Eugene.

## 2008 
“Warning! Hazards to Children: Pesticides in Oregon’s Schools,” exposing 43 student/teacher poisonings.

## 2012
Beyond Toxics organized the first Oregon Environmental Justice Bus Tour. The second event of this group is the Bus Tour where students will be taken on a bus touring toxic sites in West Eugene. They got opportunities to talk with city officials about how to take steps to prevent pollution in the air. 

## 2015 
Beyond Toxics worked with Oregonians and the legislature to pass new laws regulating aerial sprays. 

## 2017 
Eugene held its first ever Bee Count organized by Beyond Toxics, Walama Restoration Project, and with support from Oregon Department of Agriculture. The point of this is because of how important Bee's play a role in polluting plants. 

## 2019
Demanding agency compliance with fair, equitable and democratic practices. Beyond Toxins asked Lane Regional Air Protection Agency to schedule public hearings to make sure that those who are most impacted by air pollution are considered and listened to.  

## 2020 
Beyond Toxics got chlorpyrifos to phase-out of being used which led to Oregon being the fourth nation to do so.
