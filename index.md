# The Impact of Beyond Toxics on Environmental Justice in Eugene



Hello! My name is Jamie O'Connell and for my project, I chose to research about Beyond Toxics. As I was researching the environmental justice group I was not able to find a clear timeline in one place that gives information on who they are and what they have done for Eugene as a community. I chose to create a written timeline as well as a interactive timleine to show what Beyond Toxics has done over the last twenty three years. Below I have given links to show how I put my project together, starting from week one of the terms until now. Each link will lead you to information on the project and eventually builds up to a page with all of the information I gathered, followed by a link to the timeline I created for those who enjoy visually learning.

If you're a student in the class, the front page of your GitHub pages site will deploy from index.md. Put whatever content here you want to show up on your front page. Maybe that's your [white paper](white-paper.md) or your [presentation](presentation.md), or maybe you want to get fancy and embed your project here.
