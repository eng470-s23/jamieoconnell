## pitch
- My research topic is: Beyond Toxics 
- My research question is: When did Eugene wetlands become an issue and why is it targeted in bipoc communities. 
- I expect to work with the following *materials*: Data from the Beyond Toxics website, Data from the local libraies, Getting stories or news articles from families who have been affected in Eugene 
- I plan to *process* these materials by: Using data from the  ENG 470 class last spring and continue on their project of the wetland story map and looking into the history of the issue in eugene.
- I plan to *present* these materials by: Building a webiste with an interactive timeline showing when and who took over the land in west eugene and began creating a toxic area even though there are families that live there. 
- My final submission will take this form: A github website including an interactive map with stories educating the significance. 
- This project is intended to engage these audiences and communities: People who live in Eugene, People with families in Eugene and leaders in Oregon. People who look into climate change, unhealthy living situations and enviromental issues. 
- I bring the following existing knowledge and/or skills to the project: Researching a lot of information in ENG 250. Getting to read and hear a lot of the stories about people who have been affected by this issue in Eugene. Looking into the background of the issues by contacting libraies and people with information on the issue. What the leaders of this project have already done and what they plan to do. 
- In order to do this project, I need to learn: More about the issue itself. I need to find more metadata on the project and what Beyond Toxics plans to do.

# week 5
## notes
- I still have so many aritcles and short newspapers that I have found helpful and I am going to eventually use in my project. These were the main three I am researching currently and taking the most information from. I have decided to focus on the timeline of Oregon's racism to where it is today and how it affects living situations in Eugene. Hence the beyond toxics project.

## research question 
How did West Eugene get to the Environmentally injustice place it is in today?

## annotated bibliography

### source 1 annotation
- citation: Vitus , Stephanie. “The Role of the Civil Rights Movement in Oregon.” Scholarsbank, 10 Dec. 2003, https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/371. 

- summary: In Stephanie Vitus's paper she gives researches the background history of the racism that lives in Oregon. She goes into detail about Oregon during the civil rights movement as well as where Oregon stood in 1844 when slavery was outlawed. Vitus goes through the years of racism in Oregon and how the state acted during the civil rights movement. Vitus talks about citizens in Oregon, Political leaders, and even The Univeristy of Oregon and how they all reacted to the racism in this state. 

- potential use for project: This paper gives me a summarized background of the racism in Oregon and where it started. As my project will touch on the topic of racism in Oregon as a whole and how it ended up in Eugene and turned into toxic living environment, Vitus’s paper gives me a lot of history and explains it in a simple way but also gets the message across. Vitus uses dates and quotes from various audiences that give much support to the paper.


### source 2 annotation
- citation: Pak, Maylian Joan. Poverty, Race, and Community Organization: Social and Environmental Justice in Eugene, Oregon. University of Oregon, 2005.
 
- summary:  In Maylian Pak’s book she touches on the issues of Enviormental Justice and it's connection  to Race. Pak goes into the issues of Environmental Justice not only in Eugene, Oregon but where it started and how it's an issue all over the world. In her book Pak brings up the political side of fighting for environmental justice and why it is so hard to do in lower-income areas.
 
- potential use for project: I could use this in my project because of all the information that Pak gives to research on how long Eugene has been fighting for environmental justice. Pak goes into the laws that have or have not been passed and I have not found a lot of information on the political side of environmental justice and how it connects to Eugene. As I am researching my project I need to know why Eugene is struggling so hard to fight for this. This goes more into the issues of toxic waste and why it is unsafe. I have a lot of data about Eugene and its racism but I needed more information on the issues of toxic waste and its connections to poverty.

- citation: Beckner, Chrisanne. “University of Oregon Libraries.” Cultural Demolition: What Was Lost When Eugene Razed Its First Black Neighborhood?, University of Oregon, 1 Sept. 2009, https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/9976. 

- summary: In Chrisanne Becker's thesis, he goes into what changed in Eugene, Oregon when the city razed its first and only black neighborhood. Becker goes into the 1940's and gives researches all of the information on what eugene did to these black neighborhoods and how they treated families. Becker touches on the state and cities history with racism and brings in stories of families and local places in Eugene that locals today have no idea about the events that took place in their backyard. 

- potential use for project: For Beckers piece I think this will help me undercover a lot of what happened in the fourties. The horrific events that took place during this time are all in locations that I am researching in other parts of my project. I am able to read about where these families had to go and how that plays a role into what Eugene is today.

## annotated bibliography, continued

### source 4 annotation
- citation: Rethinking the Environmental Impacts of Population, Affluence And ..., www.jstor.org/stable/24706840?newaccount=true. Accessed 10 May 2023. 
- summary: Thomas Dietz and Eugene A. Rosa tell researchers about the impacts of enviromental issues and how we can understand the connection between population, resources, and enviormental impacts. They go into research about what these connections are and how researches can focus on anthropogenic enviornmental change. What the connections are between population and enviornmental research is explained in this chapter. They talk about the approaches that are taken to get the data to provide to researchers. 
- potential use for project: My use of this chapter is connecting the population impacts to enviormental impacts. The authors and researches of this chapter go into detail on why exactly the numbers connect and how it affects the population. As my research is on environmental justice and how it impacts lower income, poc neighborhoods, the data collected from this chapter can be used in my project to make sense of why these connections have such abig impact. 

### source 5 annotation
- citation: Which Lives Matter in Reproductive Biomedicine? - University of Oregon, scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/27185/Russell_WhichLivesMatter.pdf?sequence=1. Accessed 6 May 2023. 
- summary: Camisha Russell goes into the recent Black Lives Matter movement and how it brougt up a lot of issues deeper rooted in racism. During the Covid-19 pandemic the Black community saw a decrease in care for their community. Russell talks about the issues of racism in medicine and what steps are next to address the racism in medicine. 
- potential use for project: Using this for my project would bring up a different point of view. I could use Russell's information on biomedicine and its concering issue with racism. This connects with my project because the issue of toxic waste living areas is connected to biomedicine being an issue with racism and people not addressing the issue and taking action. 

### source 6 annotation
- citation: Www.Batiwatch.Ch :: Home, batiwatch.net/files/3613/7883/2581/Lave_Seskin_1970_Air_pollution__human_health.pdf. Accessed 12 May 2023. 
- summary: Lester B. Lave and Eugene P. Seskin go into the issue of air pollution and the connections and affects it has on deaths we see in the world. They started off by telling readers what the effects of air pollution are as they explain how much research has been done on the long-term effects of living and growing up in a polluted area. They bring in research that compares numbers of bronchitis, lung cancer, other cancers and pneumonia in polluted areas verus non polluted. They also bring up statistics on smokers and their health conditions. 
- potential use for project: I decided to focus on air pollution in Eugene area. In this pdf the authors bring in many statistics that I can use to include in my research. They compare health risks and connect numbers to polluted areas and how many people are affected. As I focus on ai pollution in Eugene, looking at numbers all over the world will help my research. 

### source 7 annotation
- citation: Pacheco, Christina M, et al. “Homes of Low-Income Minority Families with Asthmatic Children Have Increased Condition Issues.” Allergy and Asthma Proceedings, 2014, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4210655/. 
- summary: This article is a mix of research from multiple doctors and how lower income families have higher risks for health conditions. They studied the numbers of asthma rates in black and latino households and how they are at higher risk compared to white households. They talk about the importance of healthy homes and how unhealthy living situations cause for greater risk of long term health conditions. They did a research project to gather their own data and screened almost 1500 families in order to gather data on the asthma risk factors for children in lower income families.
- potential use for project: This helps my project because my entire research is on how lower income areas are more impacted by air pollution and at a greater risk for asthma compared to more suburban areas. I can use the research and numbers that these doctors found and compare the asthma rates in West Eugene. I am looking at how the numbers for asthma is higher for children in poc communities and this article gives me a lot of information on what I am researching. 

## environmental scan
*The environmental scan situates your project within the existing scholarly research and articulates its contribution. Answer each of the following questions in about one well-developed paragraph. You may use bulleted lists to organize your thoughts, but please write in complete sentences.*

### contribution

- I will create an interactive map or timeline showing the numbers of health issues that people in West Eugene have experienced since the biotechnology Molecular Probe was opened in 1975. The gas that this specific company releases into the air is a common factor of making asthma rates go up and impacting peoples health based on the pollution it creates in the air. As I am focusing on this specifc company and how it ties into the asthma rates in West Eugene, I think that is what makes my research and this project different. Currently there is some research on the health risks in west Eugene but I think having a timeline or map showing how they are connected and focusing specfifcally on the Molecular Probe will bring attention to a specific polluter. I hope this helps call out a company and makes legislators look at the numbers of health issues in Eugene and how it is connected to this company. 

### methods

- I have mostly used google scholar and UO libraries to find all my research so far. I plan to use the storymaps website to maybe create my timeline and eventually use kinglab.com. These are the best technologies I have used or plan to use so far because they help my project become what I want it to be in the end of my research. 

### stakeholders / audiences

- This project is intended for Oregon Public Health people. As air pollution is a big issue in Eugene, many people are currently trying to address the problem and bring the issue of enviormental justice to people higher up in Oregon. The goal is to make health legislators look at this project and the numbers and see how many residents are loosing their lives and getting serious health issues because of it. I hope to also reach the auidence of activists in Eugene, even beyond toxics project and hopes that this research will help and bring them numbers to reach legislators and get a law passed to keep polluted industries out of residental areas. 

### dependencies and resources
 
- With this project I need to make sure I read all of my articles, books, and thesis's correctly and gather the information given in a correct way. At the end of the project I hope to create a interactive map/timeline showing Eugene's air pollution. I hope to make a timeline connecting asthma rates to the air pollution area in rural areas on Eugene. For this I need to look into the kinglab.com website and figure out the correct and best way to make this timeline. I will probably use photos in the timeline so I need to confirm getting access to all of the photos I am going to use, mainly areas in Eugene that are significant to my project. Who will I contact on the photo permission? Should I take the photos of these areas or gather them from online sources? What is easier? I am using data from ENG 250 last year and have a lot of information on this project from that. I may plan on adding onto the beyond toxic github created by students last year. Is that even possible? Do I need to reach out to them? Regarding my timeline, I want to make a story map. Should I use storymaps.com?

# week 7
## notes
- To protect my data and source files from getting lost or corrupt my main goal is to add all of my data into two places to keep safe. So far all of my data has been uploaded into my github and is my main resource of data. As I continue this project and I begin to get more detailed, I want to make sure my files do not get ruined and I am now putting them in my google drive. I plan on putting my data sets into google drive on my desktop. I have downloaded gogole drive onto my desk top and anything I use for the project will be added into google drive along with continuing to add to my github. 
- My main organization idea is to label my files by the date they are published. My project is researching Beyond Toxics and where the company started with and end goal of creating a better timeline giving researchers more source and credibility for the project. I plan on renaming files of resources that I am using by naming them a nickname for what the data is and the year it was published or reported. This is easier for me to look into research as I create my timeline, I can just pull from the time frame I am working on instead of going into every file. 
- The work being backed up is my responsibility. The storage I am using for this project I hope will work later down the line for anyone to be able to access and making sure this data can be used in a couple years. 
- Any photos I use or pulling data from Toxics right to know I want to make sure everything I am going to republish is copyrighted and that I have access to use. I plan to use github to be my main publisher for my timeline and using Knight Lab to create my timeline after putting together all of my data on google sheets.
