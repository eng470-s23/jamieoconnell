# The Impact of Beyond Toxics on Environmental Justice in Eugene

**Acknowledgments**

I would like to start by acknowledging that this subject and issue has impacted a lot of families and acknowledging those that have been seriously impacted by this issue.

The process of this project could not have happened without many sources that I used for research. I would like to first give acknowledgment to the founders of Beyond Toxics (Mary O’Brien, Anita Johnson, Michael Carrigan, Steve Johnson & others ) 

As a student at the University of Oregon and a resident in Eugene, I would also like to acknowledge that this project is based on and doing research on Kalapuyla land.

**Project Overview**

Beyond Toxics is a leadership group based out of Eugene, Oregon that is a community-based environmental-justice movement group. As I was looking into their group I noticed there was not a clear form of information on their history and why it all started. For my project, I decided to research the group and how they have impacted Eugene, Oregon. 

**Background**

Beyond Toxics was founded in Eugene, Oregon in 1996 by Mary O’Brien, Anita Johnson, Michael Carrigan, and Steve Johnson. They came together as an environmental justice group to dedicate fighting for toxic use reduction and environmental justice. West Eugene neighborhoods and school districts have been mainly harmed by these toxins and they decided to come together and make a change. 

**Process**

*Research*
- Looking into who and what Beyond Toxics is. I researched for information on them looking back to when and why they first started. Looking into significant times that the group has impacted the community. 

*Development*
- Getting data from the last twenty-seven years. Looking into what laws, petitions, and movements the group has started and either resulted in success or still developing. Finding information from Beyond Toxics and then researching outside of their website and news on the topic. Matching numbers with the years regarding toxins affect. 

*Timeline*
- For my final project, I am taking all of the research I have gathered from 1996 and creating a timeline on Knightlab showing Beyond Toxics over the last twenty-seven years. The timeline will be interactive and links, photos, and videos will be embedded for researchers. 

**Statistics of West Eugene**

- "After years of residents reporting chronic health problems and awful smells in their neighborhoods, Beyond Toxics began collecting information from both residents of West Eugene and other areas of the city to identify commonly reported health problems."
(Tromblay, K. 2021, July 7)
- "An estimated 696,526 pounds of toxic chemicals were emitted in West Eugene in 2020 alone, according to the city of Eugene Toxics Reporting Program."
(Elliott, M. 2023, April 7)
- "Evaluated 22 cancer types in 6 census tracts between 2000 - 2018."

"This is an ongoing project investigating how the air pollutants being released affect the health of West Eugene’s community. West Eugene (97402 zip code) is home to an industrial corridor made up of 35 manufacturing companies. All together, 684,159 pounds of toxic chemicals were released into the environment of West Eugene in 2019--that’s 96% of all chemicals being released in the city of Eugene." Tromblay, K.
