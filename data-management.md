# about this file
Based on the [UO library research guide on data management](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management) and UO's [Basic Accessibility Testing guidance](https://digitalaccessibility.uoregon.edu/assessment/basictesting).

# expected data and formats
*Data may originate from observations, experiments, or references; it may be derived from other sources, transformed, or the result of a simulation. Describe your data file formats. Whenever possible, [use non-proprietary formats](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/fileformats) or convert your data to open, shareable formats when archiving data. Remember: data also includes your code and workflow documentation!*

- Everything will be labeled with the year and category. It can be a protest, law, project, etc. and I will have it labeled a long with the year the document took place. 

# documentation and metadata
*Describe how you will [document your data](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/readme) as you gather it. Descriptions of your data (or metadata) can help you and others locate, understand, and interpret your data. Describe the applicable standards for metadata content and format that you will follow, including the procedures and tools/software you will use to capture and edit the metadata.*

- I have documented my data right now by uploaded most things to github and keeping a google document with all my information. All of my data is also going into google drive to be more organized. It will be simple and accessible for anyone to access. 

# organization and storage
*Describe your [file naming convention and version control practices](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/filenaming). Describe [storage methods and backup procedures](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/backup) for the data, including physical and cyber resources and facilities (hard-disk space, backup server, repository). Describe how you will take into consideration privacy, security, intellectual property, and other rights.*

-  My main organization idea is to label my files by the date they are published. My project is researching Beyond Toxics and where the company started with the end goal of creating a better timeline giving researchers more sources and credibility for the project. I plan on renaming files of resources that I am using by naming them a nickname for what the data is and the year it was published or reported. This is easier for me to look into research as I create my timeline, I can just pull from the time frame I am working on instead of going into every file.

# sharing, publication, and archiving
*Describe what you will do to [provide others access to the data](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/archiving). Identify any restrictions on who may access the data and under what conditions and a timeline for providing access. Also describe your plans for preserving data, outlining any changes in access anticipated during the preservation timeline, and documenting the resources and capabilities (e.g., equipment, connections, systems, expertise) needed to meet the preservation goals.*

- The work being backed up is my responsibility. The storage I am using for this project I hope will work later down the line for anyone to be able to access and make sure this data can be used in a couple of years. I will not restrict anyone from using any of the data that I have uploaded into my timeline.  

# accessibility
*Describe your plans for ensuring that your data and project outputs are accessible for users with disabilities. Basic accessibility features include the use of alternative text for images; captions and transcripts for videos; large, easy-to-read fonts; high-contrast color schemes; text content broken up logically with section headers and lists; and links embedded [in context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context.html) rather than on phrases like [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Be specific about how you will implement accessibility features that are relevant to your data.*

- Any photos I use or pulling data from Toxics right to know I want to make sure everything I am going to republish is copyrighted and that I have access to use. I plan to use github to be my main publisher for my timeline and use Knight Lab to create my timeline after putting together all of my data on google sheets. I plan on making alt text in order for those who can't access the photos in my project are able to read what the photo is. I also plan on using headers and organizing my project with different fonts to make it accessible.
