# about this file
Based on the [UO library research guide on data management](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management) and UO's [Basic Accessibility Testing guidance](https://digitalaccessibility.uoregon.edu/assessment/basictesting).

# expected data and formats


- Everything will be labeled with the year and category. It can be a protest, law, project, etc. and I will have it labeled a long with the year the document took place. Most of my data is saved as a JPEG or a link is included in the timeline to bring viewers directly to the source. 

# documentation and metadata


- I have documented my data right now by uploaded most things to github and keeping a google document with all my information. All of my data is also going into google drive to be more organized. It will be simple and accessible for anyone to access. I have created a mockup timeline on my google docs that is also saved into my google drive. Every time stamp has a link connected that connects me to where I got my information and data from. This gives me organization and will help me put together the completed timeline. The timeline will also be created on google sheets and then turned into an interactive timeline on timeline js. 

# organization and storage


-  My main organization idea is to label my files by the date they are published. My project is researching Beyond Toxics and where the company started with the end goal of creating a better timeline giving researchers more sources and credibility for the project. I plan on renaming files of resources that I am using by naming them a nickname for what the data is and the year it was published or reported. This is easier for me to look into research as I create my timeline, I can just pull from the time frame I am working on instead of going into every file.

# sharing, publication, and archiving


- The work being backed up is my responsibility. The storage I am using for this project I hope will work later down the line for anyone to be able to access and make sure this data can be used in a couple of years. I will not restrict anyone from using any of the data that I have uploaded into my timeline. I have given copy right access to anyone who wants to use the information on my project. If anyone wants to use data from my project, most of the information is copyrighted from Beyond Toxics and they must contact and get permission from them.  

# accessibility
*Describe your plans for ensuring that your data and project outputs are accessible for users with disabilities. Basic accessibility features include the use of alternative text for images; captions and transcripts for videos; large, easy-to-read fonts; high-contrast color schemes; text content broken up logically with section headers and lists; and links embedded [in context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context.html) rather than on phrases like [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Be specific about how you will implement accessibility features that are relevant to your data.*

- Any photos I use or pulling data from Toxics right to know I want to make sure everything I am going to republish is copyrighted and that I have access to use. I plan to use github to be my main publisher for my timeline and use Knight Lab to create my timeline after putting together all of my data on google sheets. I plan on making alt text in order for those who can't access the photos in my project are able to read what the photo is. I also plan on using headers and organizing my project with different fonts to make it accessible.
